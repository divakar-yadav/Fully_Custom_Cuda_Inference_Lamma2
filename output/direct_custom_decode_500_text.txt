about to become a reality as Apple has announced that their latest iPhone, the iPhone 8 Plus will be able to recognize faces and label them with human-like emotions.
Augmented Reality in virtual reality or mixed reality is an enhanced version of the real world that combines digital information with your actual surroundings to make it more meaningful to you. In other words, augmented reality is where you can use your smartphone camera to see something, not what is actually there but some type of virtual representation overlaying the images right before your eyes.
In AR, apps are designed to interact with your environment and enhance it by showing you things like the locations of nearby restaurants, supermarkets or even provide directions as if they were overlaid onto a physical map of your current location at any given time during daylight hours only. These applications allow users to take advantage of their phones’ built-in cameras for different purposes such as detecting objects in front of them so that they know exactly which ones should be avoided while driving down an unknown road at night without having light at all around them; tracking people walking through crowded areas where street lights may not always work well enough due to poor maintenance on sidewalks; finding out what kind food items are available near you based upon your geographic coordinates alone by using GPS data from Google Maps mobile apps installed into every smartphone available today – including those made by Samsung, Apple & Nokia among others.
The future of augmented reality is going to change the way we interact with our surroundings. We’ll be able to see things that aren’t there, and interact with them in ways never before possible. AR will transform how we experience the world around us, and it has the potential to revolutionize everything from education to entertainment.
AR-enabled glasses will allow users not only view 3D objects on their screens but also walk through them while remaining within physical space itself – this means that instead of just looking at something online or watching movies on TV screens inside homes like today; people can now go out into real world places where they want without any hassle whatsoever because all they need do is put those goggles on then take off again whenever necessary for another adventure!
Augmented reality is a new technology that uses computer vision, data processing and machine learning to augment the physical world
